# QoS Analysis in Ride Hailing Services

## Motivation
* A huge amount of GPS  data, Trip Data is generated in ride-hailing services.
* GPS data is available for all driver-partners, unlike complaints and ratings -fair method.
* Safe/Unsafe driving is a highly important factor of QoS of a taxi driver.
* Can be used in  determining deserving driver partners in reward programmes.

## Problem Statement
* Existing driver behaviour analysis only focuses on subjective analysis. There is no effective, realistic and objective performance measuring approach for driver behaviour using GPS data.
## Results
* GPS Data Based Novel Ranking Model for Drivers in Ride Hailing Services
* Globally Usable HMM based  Map Matching Algorithm
* Conference Paper on Driving Behaviour Analysis using Low Sampling GPS Trajectories of Ride-hailing Services for 5th IEEE DSIT Conference

## Conclusion
* Driver Behaviour analysis is become an important  consideration in deciding the service quality of Ride
hailing services.
* Current driver ranking systems are  mainly based on the average star rating and customer complaints.
* We have proposed a driver behaviour analysis model based on GPS data
