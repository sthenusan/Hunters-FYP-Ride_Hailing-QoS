# QoS Analysis in Ride Hailing Services

## Motivation
* A huge amount of GPS  data, Trip Data is generated in ride-hailing services.
* GPS data is available for all driver-partners, unlike complaints and ratings -fair method.
* Safe/Unsafe driving is a highly important factor of QoS of a taxi driver.
* Can be used in  determining deserving driver partners in reward programmes.
